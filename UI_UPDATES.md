# Desired UI updates

- Move "project root:" display to right of "Library" heading, right aligned
- Move "Choose different folder" button to next to "project root:", Change label to to "Change"
- Repaint the ui after batch of like 25 images. Do this however is most efficent. Too many repaints looks confusing.
- Group images by parent folder. Sort by parent folder name. To keep things simple, the folders can be full paths (after root) "/styles/posted", "styles", etc.
- Folder groups should be collapsible. Default to open.
- Move saved indicator to right of image file name
